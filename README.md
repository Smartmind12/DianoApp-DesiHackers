## What It Does?
The Diano app is a fully operational ecommerce site where users can purchase products from Vardiano. Once the user arrives to the app, they will have a choice to sign up or sign in. They can also customize their profile as per their preference. If not, they can continue as a guest. Users can browse through products, and purchase them via the app. They can also connect with Vardiano via social media and contact them, if needed. 

Kindly note: It is an app currently working in dark mode of application and not Lightmode yet.

## How We Built It?
We built this app using quite a few frameworks. We used Figma for UI and flutteflow for front end, mainly building the app. We wanted to use appwrite for the backend but we did not have enough time.

## Challenges We Ran Into:
We ran into quite a few challenges with this project. It was a bit hard to collaborate with other developers due to differences in time zone. We did not have much experience in building apps with Flutterflow so we had to learn more about it, before we could start building. Completing the project within the given time frame was also challenging, especially because our former team disbanded.

## What's Next For Our Project?
We plan on adding more features, such as implementing Hedera for secure payments as well as coil for monetization. We also want to implement a backend using appwrite. 

## Technologies Used
Figma, Flutterflow, Flutter
